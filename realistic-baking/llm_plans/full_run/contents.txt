1. Precondition targeting.
    - stopped at iteration 686.
2. problem4a.txt
3. Demonstration when get stuck: (remove-pan-from-oven pan-0 oven-0), (put-pan-in-oven pan-0 oven-1)
    - stopped at iteration 720
4. problem4b.txt
5. When get stuck (move-baked-good executing without learning), provide the demonstrations (remove-pan-from-oven pan-0 oven-0), (move-baked-good-in-container-to-different-container pan-0 plate-0 dessert-0)
    - May need to do this a couple of times.
6. After this, should pass 20/22 cases, at around iteration 923.

8. problem4f.txt
    - Should pass 21/22 cases, only 2 souffles left
