Note, if the train goals are too hard for the LLM, then define instead subgoals that would make it easier for the LLM:
5. (mixture-is-smooth-and-thick ?mixture-0)
6. (is-mixture-airy ?mixture-0)
7. (container-in-an-oven ?pan-0)
8. (mixture-has-raw-egg-yolk ?mixture-0) (mixture-has-raw-egg-whites ?mixture-0) (mixture-has-cups-of-flour ?mixture-0)



Example Tasks:
# For different tasks, the predicate and object descriptions could be different, so that a simplified domain could work.
